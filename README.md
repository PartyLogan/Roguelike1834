# Roguelike1834
Roguelike for the /r/roguelikedev 2023 tutorialathon.

Made with raylib and c++ (initially was using rust and macroquad but came crawling back to oop).

Not the best at c++ so don't look too closely.

Using the LOSPEC500 PALETTE: https://lospec.com/palette-list/lospec500
and Kenny's 1bit pack: https://kenney.nl/assets/1-bit-pack
